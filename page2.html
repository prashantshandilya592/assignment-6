            It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a
            map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look
            again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What
            could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at
            the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his
            mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read
            maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward
            town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. <br>

           <br> But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual
            morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
            about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw
            on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel
            and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly
            together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be
            older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that
            this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that
            would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot,
            his mind back on drills.
